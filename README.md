## Algorithms on Graphs Programming Assignment 04: Paths in Graphs 2
### Problems
Focus on shortest paths in weighted graphs:
* [`/src/dijkstra/Dijkstra.java`](src/dijkstra/Dijkstra.java): Problem 1, Computing the Minimum Cost of a Flight, minimizes the total cost of a flight (PASSED);
* [`/src/negative_cycle/NegativeCycle.java`](src/negative_cycle/NegativeCycle.java): Problem 2, Detecting Anomalies in Currency Exchange Rates, checks whether it is possible to start with one unit of some currency, perform a sequence of exchanges, and get more than one unit of the same currency;
* [`/src/shortest_paths/ShortestPaths.java`](src/shortest_paths/ShortestPaths.java): Advanced Problem 3, Exchanging Money Optimally, computes an optimal way of exchanging the given currency into all other currencies.
